## How to contribute to free_zipcode_data

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/midwire/free_zipcode_data/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/midwire/free_zipcode_data/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read run [Rubocop](http://batsov.com/rubocop/) on your code. If your PR fails our Rubocop convensions defined in `.rubocop.yml`, it will likely be rejected on those grounds.

* Ensure that you write RSpec tests that cover any new or modified code. PR's without spec coverage will likely be rejected.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Free Zipcode Data will generally not be accepted.

Thanks for any contributions!
